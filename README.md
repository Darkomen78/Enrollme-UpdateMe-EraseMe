UpdateMe and Erase&Install
==========

Some stuff to facilitate macOS major update or full erase and reinstall for non-admin users.

__A working Munki installation is required.__ (https://github.com/munki/munki)

You can make two packages to split these functions in two items for Munki.
The IT folder can be relocated, but beware of the folder access confidential limitation and change ITFOLDER variable in both post-install scripts.
